    <h2>Proposition: Civilian complaints unfairly affect and target White police officers in New York City</h2>

		<section>
      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="../images/6.C35_a4_vis2.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Minorities target White police officers in civilian complaints
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> I used the Flourish Alluvial step-by-step sorted to reduce overlaps,
					meaning that the ethnicities are sorted based on which has the biggest numbers on either side.
				</li> The display of the number of complainants and officers might be redundant because
				it is already illustrated through the thickness of the line.
				<li>
					The colors were also chosen by Flourish in order to fit the same color scheme and blend from one side to the other.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Similar to the next data visualization,
				this one also does not compare the prevalence of ethnicities in the complainant and officer sections to the ethnic makeup of those populations as a whole.
				The claim of this visualization, intent, is also much harder to prove than calculating rates of promotions.
				Because of that, I would rate it -2 on a scale from deceptive (-2) to earnest (2).

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>
				<img src="../images/6.C35_a4_vis1.png" alt="" />
				<figcaption>
					Civilian complaints have little effect on the career trajectory of New York police officers
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li> Time goes from left to right, from the incident of the complaint to 2020. </li>
				<li> I used the Flourish Alluvial step-by-step sorted to reduce overlaps so that I could visualize career trajectory. </li>
				<li>It might make more sense to have the ranks go from lowest on the bottom to highest on the top,
					so that the connecting lines correlate to rises in position.
					This would make it easier to differentiate promotions and demotions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				I would rate this visualization 1 on a scale from deceptive (-2) to earnest (2).
				Even though the lines showing demotions in rank are very thin,
				such as the line from detective to police officer which has 13 people,
				the visualization does not compare it to the general rate of demotions in the police force,
				so it might be true that the rate of demotions is actually much higher for officers with complaints filed against them.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>It was difficult for me to create opposing visualizations with exactly the same data,
		so I interpreted the assignment more generally by creating a visualization with a claim that was criticizing the police establishment and one that was criticizing the civilian complainants.
		The claim that civilian complaints have little effect on the career trajectory of New York police officers seemed pretty well supported by the data,
		although it would require more specific details of the in-between time as well as a comparison to police officers who have not been the subject of complaints.
		On the other hand, the claim that minorities target White police officers is not supported by the data,
		requires much more context, and is harmful towards a marginalized group. <br>

		Ethical analysis and visualization attempts to explore all the possibilities instead of settling on one that supports the preconceived beliefs of the analyst.
		Ethical analysis places data in a wider context without sweeping aside details that don’t support the analyst’s claim.
		Ethical analysis and visualization looks for the human stories inside the data and the human consequences of the analyst’s claim.
		These are key pieces for interpreting data earnestly and with the goal of education and understanding.

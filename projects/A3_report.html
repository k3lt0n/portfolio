			<p>
				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>the pandemic peaked in dec/jan 2021 and again in jan 2022</li>
				<li>the period with the least cases was summer 2021</li>
				<li>the pandemic has gotten worse over time</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>potentially suggests that radial distance is measuring something</li>
				<li>it is confusing that the spiral does not begin in the center</li>
				<li>the intended takeaway is unclear</li>
				<li>easy to compare seasons of different years</li>
				<li>unconventional and aesthetically interesting, drawing the reader in but also requiring close reading</li>
				<li>the spiral portrays time continuously</li>

			<h2>Visualization Sketches</h2>

					Sketch 1: Covid Cases and Deaths
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>Design Rationale</p>
			<p>
				This graph includes deaths as well as case counts.
				The original spiral visualization only displays the number of cases, but not the number of deaths.
				This could lead to a viewer believing that the pandemic has gotten more and more deadly overtime,
				when actually the newer variants and increased immunity mean that the virus is more transmissible and less deadly.
				Ideally, plotting cases and deaths on the y-axis should show how each spike in cases is lagged by a spike in deaths.
				But, having two y-axes plotting different things at a different scale is very misleading and hard to read.
				Instead, color could be used to show the percentage of deaths out of cases, displaying how deadly the virus is at different points in time.
			</p>
			<p>
				This graph separates time into two years on top of each other and sets the x-axis to zero.
				This makes it easier for me to compare the area under the line with the quantities all above of the x-axis instead of centered on the x-axis.
				Although this could make visual comparison easier, it loses the continuous depiction of time from the spiral.
				Next, I will try a different visualization that displays time continuously.
			</p>

			<p>
				This graph includes annotations of relevant events in the timeline.
				The original graph only depicts the case counts.
				The spiral allows the viewer to notice trends in case counts depending on the time of year.
				In the new graph, you can also easily compare times of year and there is space for additional annotations, as well.
				I included when Covid vaccines first became available and the appearances of new variants,
				which are factors that could affect virus lethality or case count.

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I chose to draw the graph as curving back and forth to retain continuity between years while also making efficient use of screen space.
					I was hoping that this would be less confusing than a spiral, but I think both are not super easy to read.
				</li>
				<li>I encoded the winter and summer months with the colors blue and red to draw attention to seasonal variations in Covid cases.
					The essay accompanying the original graph highlighted that the author was concerned about high case counts he predicted in the coming winter months,
					and the spiral visualization could have highlighted that with annotations.
				</li>
				<li>The annotations highlight the winter peaks to emphasize that the purpose of the visualization is to highlight winter surges.
					The graph was published at the beginning of January 2022, warning about the case counts in January and February. </li>
			</ul>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I returned to the original spiral design because of how it portrayed time as continuous
					and how it emphasizes how trends in Covid cases are correlated with seasons.
				</li>
				<li>I tried to make the surges more clear by adding color, with blue for low case counts and red for surges.
					I used red and blue because I only had 2 pens, but if I did this again I would use a gradient from white to
					dark blue, because there is no meaningful center.
				</li>
				<li>I did not include radial lines extending from the center so that it was clear that nothing is being measured radially.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Design Process & Design Decisions</h2>

		<p>
			This final design used a flat x-axis, a bar chart of case numbers of time, annotations of key time periods and events,
			and the virus lethality rate encoded by color.
        </p>

      <h3>Reflection</h3>

      <p>
		I decided that maintaining a flat x-axis would make visual comparison of case numbers easier
		and allow for annotations to fit more easily. I annotated the map to highlight the seasons with highest
		and lowest temperatures because this is less obvious outside of a spiral. I also included the date that
		vaccines became publicly available, as this affected virus lethality. Finally, I encoded the deadliness
		of the virus in the color of the bars, with darkest as an almost 2% fatality rate. These decisions
		emphasize the takeaway that although the virus is being transmitted more easily is the pandemic continues,
		it is much less deadly. <br>

		This does address my critiques of the original graph, especially that it does not have a clear takeaway.
		Hidden in the essay, the author states that “Our models project that the United States is likely to document 
		more Covid-19 cases in January than in any previous month of the pandemic, 
		but a smaller fraction of those cases will require hospitalization.” The 2nd half of this takeaway is not reflected
		in the original visualization, which might even lead viewers to believe the opposite: that the virus has become worse
		over time.

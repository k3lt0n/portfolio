			<p>
				Design Rationale
			</p>
			<p>
				This graph includes deaths as well as case counts.
				The original spiral visualization only displays the number of cases, but not the number of deaths.
				This could lead to a viewer believing that the pandemic has gotten more and more deadly overtime,
				when actually the newer variants and increased immunity mean that the virus is more transmissible and less deadly.
				Ideally, plotting cases and deaths on the y-axis should show how each spike in cases is lagged by a spike in deaths.
				But, having two y-axes plotting different things at a different scale is very misleading and hard to read.
				Instead, color could be used to show the percentage of deaths out of cases, displaying how deadly the virus is at different points in time.
			</p>
			<p>
				This graph separates time into two years on top of each other and sets the x-axis to zero.
				This makes it easier for me to compare the area under the line with the quantities all above of the x-axis instead of centered on the x-axis.
				Although this could make visual comparison easier, it loses the continuous depiction of time from the spiral.
				Next, I will try a different visualization that displays time continuously.
			</p>

			<p>
				This graph includes annotations of relevant events in the timeline.
				The original graph only depicts the case counts.
				The spiral allows the viewer to notice trends in case counts depending on the time of year.
				In the new graph, you can also easily compare times of year and there is space for additional annotations, as well.
				I included when Covid vaccines first became available and the appearances of new variants,
				which are factors that could affect virus lethality or case count.

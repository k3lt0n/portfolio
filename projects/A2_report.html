			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
				<li>Which areas had the most negative and most positive HOLC city survey ratings?</li>
				<li>What were the ratios of residential, commercial, and industrial areas in the different towns?</li>
				<li>Did the "hazardous" HOLC ratings correspond to industrial areas?</li> <br>

				<figcaption>
				The Homeowner's Loan Association (HOLC) was a federal agency that mapped American cities according to lending risk.
				Neighborhood classification included "best," "still desirable," "definitely declining," and hazardous.
				This map ranks the Boston Area in terms of how many "hazardous" designations each area recieved.

				<figcaption>
				Boston had the highest number of "hazardous" designations from the previous graph.
				From this graph, we can see that around a quarter of its neighborhoods were marked as hazardous,
				while almost half were marked as "definitely declining."

				<figcaption>
					If we include the "definitely declining" markings along with "hazardous," Boston is still in the lead.
					Towns without these rankings include Waltham, Winthrop, Braintree, and Milton.

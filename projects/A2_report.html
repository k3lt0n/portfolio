				The Homeowner's Loan Association (HOLC) was a federal agency that mapped American cities according to lending risk.
				Neighborhood classification included "best," "still desirable," "definitely declining," and hazardous.
				This map ranks the Boston Area in terms of how many "hazardous" designations each area recieved.

				<figcaption>
				Boston had the highest number of "hazardous" designations from the previous graph.
				From this graph, we can see that around a quarter of its neighborhoods were marked as hazardous,
				while almost half were marked as "definitely declining."

				<figcaption>
					If we include the "definitely declining" markings along with "hazardous," Boston is still in the lead.
					Towns without these rankings include Waltham, Winthrop, Braintree, and Milton.

					These towns had the most favorable ratings from the HOLC when they created their maps in the 1950s.
					They have many "best" and "still desirable" rated neighborhoods.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p> 
				It is interesting to see how these neighborhoods were viewed by the HOLC in the past and how they exist today.
				The system of redlining determined who could access loans and home ownership, which are significant contributors
				to the accumulation of wealth. These government policies from the past are relevant to the wealth distribution of today.
				How do they affect Boston communities today? What can be done to address this?
